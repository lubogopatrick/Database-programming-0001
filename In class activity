 SQL commands to complete 

a. Create the table

CREATE TABLE Donation (
  Donor Id VARCHAR(10),
  Department VARCHAR(10),

);


b. Create an index on the Department attribute

CREATE INDEX idx_Department ON Donation (Department);


*c. Create a stored procedure

CREATE PROCEDURE sp_Donation_Management
  @Amount INT = NULL,
  @Department VARCHAR(10) = NULL,
  @NewDepartmentName VARCHAR(10) = NULL,
  @GivenAmount INT = NULL
AS
BEGIN
  -- 1. Insert records
  INSERT INTO Donation (Donorid, Department, Amount)
  VALUES ('D/125', 'CT', 25000),
         ('D/67', '555', 12000),
         ('D/45', 'CT', 15000),
         ('D/16', 'ΝΟΥ', NULL),
         ('D/7', 'SOT', NULL),
         ('D/350', 'SOB', 11000);

  -- ii. Display amount given per donor
  SELECT Donorid, SUM(Amount) AS TotalAmount
  FROM Donation
  GROUP BY Donorid;

  -- iii. Display total amount received by Computing department
  SELECT SUM(Amount) AS TotalAmount
  FROM Donation
  WHERE Department = 'CT';

  -- iv. Delete records with no amount received
  DELETE FROM Donation
  WHERE Amount IS NULL;

  -- v. Delete records with amount below a given amount
  DELETE FROM Donation
  WHERE Amount < @GivenAmount;

  -- vi. Display total amount received by institution using OUT parameter
  DECLARE @TotalAmount INT;
  SELECT @TotalAmount = SUM(Amount) FROM Donation;
  PRINT @TotalAmount;

  -- vii. Change department name
  UPDATE Donation
  SET Department = @NewDepartmentName
  WHERE Department = @Department;

  -- viii. Display number of donations received by university using OUT parameter
  DECLARE @DonationCount INT;
  SELECT @DonationCount = COUNT(*) FROM Donation;
  PRINT @DonationCount;
END;
